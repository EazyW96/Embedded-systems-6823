# SignalScout: An Autonomous Guided Vehicle

## **Project Overview**
SignalScout is an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) project developed for the SWE 6823 Embedded Systems class. The system uses a Raspberry Pi, motors, a camera, sensors, and RF modules to detect and navigate to a beacon emitting a specific radio frequency while avoiding obstacles. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for the project.

## **Features**
- **RF Beacon Detection**: Locate a beacon emitting a specific radio frequency.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Navigate around obstacles using sensor data.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Efficient motor control and navigation algorithms.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Process data from sensors and RF modules in real-time.
