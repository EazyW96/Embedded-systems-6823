Design Diagrams Document PDF

This document provides detailed visual representations of the system architecture.
It includes block diagrams, flowcharts, and schematic representations that illustrate:
 - The overall structure of the autonomous navigation system.
 - The interactions between hardware components (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Freenove 4WD Kit, sensors).
 - The logical flow of software modules and data processing.

Developers can use these diagrams to quickly understand system design decisions and hardware/software integration.
